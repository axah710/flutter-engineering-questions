# "Adding patterns everywhere" for enterprise look

**Q:** A junior suggests "adding patterns everywhere" to look "enterprise-grade." Given a relatively simple app, how would you decide which patterns to use and which to avoid?

**Key answers:**

- Choose patterns only when they reduce real pain (duplication, tight coupling, hard testing).
- Keep a small "approved patterns" list and require justification for new frameworks/abstractions.
- Prefer the simplest thing that keeps code readable and testable.
