# Flutter vs native / React Native

**Q:** Your company is deciding between maintaining separate native apps, using React Native, or standardizing on Flutter for mobile and desktop. You are asked to recommend a path. How do you evaluate Flutter's strengths/weaknesses for their product roadmap, and what do you suggest?

**Key answers:**

- Evaluate by product needs: UI richness, time-to-market, platform coverage (mobile/desktop/web), plugin maturity, and team skills.
- Validate with a spike: build one real "hard" feature (animations, offline, auth, deep links) and measure performance + dev speed.
- Suggest a phased strategy: Flutter for shared UI/features, keep native for niche platform-heavy modules if needed.
