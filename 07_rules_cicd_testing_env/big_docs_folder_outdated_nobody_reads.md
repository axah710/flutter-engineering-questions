# Big docs folder outdated — nobody reads it

**Q:** The project has a big docs folder that no one reads because it is outdated. How would you redesign the documentation process so that it remains "living" and trustworthy?

**Key answers:**

- Replace big docs with small, owned docs: one-page per feature/module, updated by owners.
- Automate parts (API docs, build commands) and keep examples executable.
- Add "docs freshness" checks (last updated, required sections) and delete stale content aggressively.
