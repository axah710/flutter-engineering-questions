# EU and US markets — GDPR/CCPA

**Q:** The app will be used in both EU and US markets. How would you handle consent, data access, and deletion features to comply with GDPR/CCPA in the Flutter app?

**Key answers:**

- Implement consent flows, "download my data," and "delete my account/data" requests backed by server support.
- Provide region-aware prompts and keep audit logs server-side.
- Ensure third-party SDKs respect consent signals.
