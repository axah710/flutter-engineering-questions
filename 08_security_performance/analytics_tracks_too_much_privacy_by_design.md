# Analytics tracks too much — privacy-by-design

**Q:** Your analytics implementation currently tracks too much data and possibly violates some privacy regulations. How would you redesign it to follow privacy-by-design and give users control over their data?

**Key answers:**

- Data minimization: collect only what you need, with short retention and clear purpose.
- Add consent controls and a privacy settings screen (opt-in where required).
- Anonymize/pseudonymize identifiers and avoid collecting sensitive attributes.
