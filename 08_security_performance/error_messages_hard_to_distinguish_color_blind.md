# Error messages hard to distinguish (color-blind)

**Q:** A color-blind user reports that error messages are difficult to distinguish from normal text. How would you adjust your design and implementation to fix this?

**Key answers:**

- Don't rely on color alone: add icons, text, and spacing; ensure sufficient contrast.
- Use theme tokens for error styling consistently across the app.
- Validate with color-blind simulators and contrast tools.
