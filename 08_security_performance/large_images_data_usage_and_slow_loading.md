# Large images — data usage and slow loading

**Q:** Your app loads large images over mobile networks and users complain about data usage and slow loading. How would you optimize image formats, caching, and loading strategies to improve UX and reduce data usage?

**Key answers:**

- Serve responsive images (multiple sizes), modern formats, and enable CDN caching.
- Use placeholders and progressive loading; prefetch only when it improves UX.
- Cache with eviction and respect user settings (data saver).
