## Why this repo?

| | |
|---|---|
| **Study** | Deep-dive into architecture, internals, and best practices |
| **Interviews** | Prepare for senior Flutter / mobile engineering roles |
| **Reference** | Quick lookup for patterns, lifecycle, and tooling |

Every topic lives in its own folder with a single **`questions_and_answers.md`** file: **Q** → **Key answers** (no fluff, no resource links).
