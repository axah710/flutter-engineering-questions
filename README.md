## 📄 Format inside each topic file

- **Q:** — full question  
- **Key answers:** — short bullet list

---

## 🎯 Situation-based interview style

- Q&A use **concrete situations** (e.g. “List screen is laggy with real data”, “Stakeholder wants a quick demo hack”) and ask how you’d handle them.
- **Why:** Shows real solution knowledge (not just theory), reasoning and trade-offs, and how you’d behave on a real team.
