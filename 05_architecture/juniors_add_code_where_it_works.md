# Juniors add code "where it works"

**Q:** Junior developers keep adding code in random places "where it works." How would you coach them and adjust the project structure to enforce good architectural boundaries?

**Key answers:**

- Provide a "where does this go?" guide and code templates for common additions.
- Set up review gates (owners per module) and CI rules that catch forbidden imports.
- Keep examples in-repo (one feature implemented "the right way").
